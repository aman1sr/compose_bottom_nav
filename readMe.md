- The Navigation component has three main parts:
    - NavController: Responsible for navigating between destinationsâ€”that is, the screens in your app.
    - NavGraph: Maps composable destinations to navigate to. 
    - NavHost: Composable acting as a container for displaying the current destination of the NavGraph.

- Route :
